# About
This project was created mainly as a way for me to learn some swift/swiftUI, but it can be useful too! Downloads Cleaner will scan your downloads folder, and then sort all of the files into subfolders based on file type, e.g. Images, Applications, Archives, etc. There is also an option to empty the downloads folder, which will simply delete all the contents.

# Usage
Using is pretty simple. Open up the app, select the options you want, press "Choose" and navigate to your downloads folder (if it is your first time opening), and then hit "Clean!". If you want to empty the folder instead, just his "Empty".
